# TaskWiz

TaskWiz is a modern, animated, and responsive Todo App built with **Vite**, **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React Redux**, and **Framer Motion**. The app allows users to create and manage tasks, with the ability to store task history using local storage so tasks persist even when the app is revisited.

## Features

- **Add and Delete Tasks**: Easily create and remove tasks with an intuitive interface.
- **Framer Motion Animations**: Smooth animations for task additions and deletions to enhance user experience.
- **Redux State Management**: Global state management for tasks, ensuring seamless performance.
- **Persistent Task Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so you can revisit the app later and pick up where you left off.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive interface using Tailwind CSS, making the app look great on any device.
- **Tech Stack Icons**: Icons at the bottom of the app display the technologies used to build the project (Tailwind CSS, Redux, and Framer Motion).

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
